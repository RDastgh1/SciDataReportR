SciDataReportR combines custom wrappers and new functions to streamline
scientific data reporting in a reproducible manner. The goal is to allow
for easy EDA and data analysis with many combinations of variables to
allow for both hypothesis generation and hypothesis-driven analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SciDataReportR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RDastgh1/SciDataReportR")
```

## How-To

We are finalizing work on a vignette, but for how please find examples
within these quarto slides:
<https://rdastgh1.quarto.pub/rmedicine-2024-scidatareportr>

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->

<!-- library(SciDataReportR) -->

<!-- ## basic example code -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->

<!-- summary(cars) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->

<!-- plot(pressure) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
