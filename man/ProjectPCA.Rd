\title{Project PCA scores onto new data}
\usage{
ProjectPCA(
  Data,
  VarsToReduce = NULL,
  PCAInput,
  InputType = c("PCAObj", "LoadingTable"),
  center = TRUE,
  scale = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{Data frame on which to project PCA scores.}

\item{VarsToReduce}{Optional character vector of variable names to use.
If NULL, uses all variables that appear in both Data and the PCA solution.}

\item{PCAInput}{Either:
\itemize{
\item the full object returned by CreatePCATable (when InputType = "PCAObj"), or
\item a loading table like CreatePCATable()$LoadingTable (when InputType = "LoadingTable").
}}

\item{InputType}{One of "PCAObj" or "LoadingTable".}

\item{center}{Logical; only used when InputType is "LoadingTable".
For "PCAObj", the centering choice is taken from PCAInput$ScaleParams$center
and this argument is ignored (with a warning if it conflicts).}

\item{scale}{Logical; only used when InputType is "LoadingTable".
For "PCAObj", the scaling choice is taken from PCAInput$ScaleParams$scale
and this argument is ignored (with a warning if it conflicts).}
}
\value{
A list with:
\item{Scores}{Data frame of projected PCA scores.}
\item{CombinedData}{Original Data with scores appended as new columns.}
\item{LoadingsUsed}{Matrix of loadings used for projection.}
\item{PCAObj}{PCA object used (if InputType is "PCAObj"), otherwise NULL.}
\item{VarsUsed}{Variables used from Data for projection.}
\item{Center}{Logical flag indicating whether centering was applied for projection.}
\item{Scale}{Logical flag indicating whether scaling was applied for projection.}
}
\description{
Use an existing PCA solution (either a PCA object from CreatePCATable or
a loading table) to compute principal component scores on a new dataset.
