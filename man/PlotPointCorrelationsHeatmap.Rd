\title{Plot Point-Biserial Correlations Between Binary and Continuous Variables}
\usage{
PlotPointCorrelationsHeatmap(
  Data,
  CatVars,
  ContVars,
  Covariates = NULL,
  Relabel = TRUE,
  Ordinal = TRUE,
  binary_map = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{A dataframe.}

\item{CatVars}{Character vector of binary categorical variables.}

\item{ContVars}{Character vector of continuous variables.}

\item{Covariates}{Optional covariates (reserved).}

\item{Relabel}{Logical; use sjlabelled variable labels for axes.}

\item{Ordinal}{Logical; reserved for future use.}

\item{binary_map}{Optional mapping as returned by \code{createBinaryMapping()}.
If NULL, a mapping is created internally for \code{CatVars}.}
}
\value{
A list with Unadjusted, FDRCorrected, method ("R_pb"), Relabel, Covariates, BinaryMapping.
}
\description{
Calculates point-biserial correlations (binary vs continuous) with explicit 0/1 coding
where 1 == PositiveLevel from \code{createBinaryMapping()}, and renders heatmap-style tiles.
